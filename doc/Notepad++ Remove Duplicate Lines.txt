The munched norwegian_large.txt file contains many duplicates.

This is how it is cleaned:

Notepad++ can do this, provided you wanted to sort by line, and remove the duplicate lines at the same time.

You will need the TextFX plugin. This used to be included in older versions of Notepad++, but if you have a newer version, you can add it from the menu by going to Plugins -> Plugin Manager -> Show Plugin Manager -> Available tab -> TextFX -> Install. In some cases it may also be called TextFX Characters, but this is the same thing

The check boxes and buttons required will now appear in the menu under: TextFX -> TextFX Tools.

Make sure "sort outputs only unique..." is checked. Next, select a block of text (Ctrl+A to select the entire document). Finally, click "sort lines case sensitive" or "sort lines case insensitive"



1. Open in Notepad++
2. Sort: Edit -> Line Operations -> Sort Ascending
3. Run the following regexp from 
http://www.regular-expressions.info/duplicatelines.html

Do a search-and-replace searching for 
^(.*)(\r?\n\1)+$
and replacing with \1.
Make sure 'matches newline' is NOT checked


OR (crashes)

Do a search-and-replace searching for 
^(.*?)$\s+?^(?=.*^\1$)
and replace with nothing. 

This leaves from all duplicate rows the last occurrence in the file.
No sorting is needed for that and the duplicate rows can be anywhere in the file!
You need to check the options "Regular expression" and ". matches newline":
