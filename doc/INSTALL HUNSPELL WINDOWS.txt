==== Step 1: install hunspell

hunspell doesn't require installation in the Windows sense: you only need to 
place it somewhere, anywhere.  Except as in step 2 below, it has no effect at 
all on Windows.

    a. Download the hunspell installation kit from

       http://sourceforge.net/projects/ezwinports/files

       I have hunspell-1.3.2-2-w32-bin.zip.

    b. Extract the contents of the zipfile to any directory. I chose

       D:\hunspell

==== Step 2: add hunspell to Windows PATH

This step may be unnecessary, and I'll probably try removing it.  But here's 
how:

    a. Start --> Control Panel --> System --> Advanced system settings -->
       "Advanced" tab --> Environment Variables

    b. In the "System variables" window select "Path" and click "Edit..."

    c. A window "Edit System Variable" will pop up showing the current
       value of "Path".  At the end of that string add

       ;{folder for hunspell.exe}

       which on my system is

       ;D:\hunspell\bin

    d. Click your way out: OK --> OK --> OK --> close the control panel
       window.

==== Step 3: add the dictionaries you want

There are many sources of dictionaries.

    a. Put the dictionaries where hunspell expects to find them, in

       ...\share\hunspell

       On my system that is

       D:\hunspell\share\hunspell

    b. I added these dictionaries:

       de_DE_frami (de_DE_frami.aff and de_DE_frami.dic)
       en_US (en_US.aff and en_US.dic)
       fr-classique (fr-classique.aff and fr-classique.dic)
